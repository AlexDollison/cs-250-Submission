#Q: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
#A: User needs should come from a number of questions asked before the project or product is started, and more questions for clarification should occur during the development process either as sections are completed, or as tests are completed. User stories allow developers and testers to focus down the most important "stories" or aspects of a project first, ask the most relevant questions, and continue the development using the user stories as a guide.

#Q: How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
#A: Some of the core principles of agile include generating user stories, agile ceremonies (for large teams), continuous integration and development, and identifying sprint length. All of these processes are important for development of software and should be followed with some leniency to allow for learning of new processes that may be discovered later down the road. My personal approach to developing programs is to ensure the quality meets the company's standards and that the client's needs are met with that same quality.

#Q: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
#A: Being a good team member means keeping up with the quality of the team, respecting your team members and their work, ensuring you fulfill your role on the team, that you take responsibility for your actions in fulfilling your role, and that you communicate well with your team. The biggest part of developing software on such a scale is that you and your team are on the same wavelength. If you're doing something unrelated to the rest of the team, you are burdening your team and the company.
